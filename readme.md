# Welcome

This is sample code for a project, front and backend to handle bulk communication with citizens. Angular, .Net C#, AWS

Certain pieces have been scrubbed to remove private or propriatry information. The application as is will thus not run, and is only here to demonstrate the code required for this process.

This has been purpose-built to run on an Azure Cloud application server, but can be deployed cross-platform.
